# hffp-book

This repository contains source code, exercises, related topics and some additional material that I've got (directly or indirectly) from the amazing [Haskell programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com/) book.

## Places worth to check

There is lots of random unstructured stuff here, so probably these are the places that could be the most interesting for you:

> Std library

* [Monoid, Functor, Applicative, Monad, Foldable and Traversable class definitions](ch21-traversable/src/Sand/ClassDef.hs)

> Parsers

* [Semantic version parser](ch24-parser-combinators/src/chex/SemVer.hs)
